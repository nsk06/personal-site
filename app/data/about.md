#### Intro

#### Some Informal Stuff

I believe to know a person you must spend some time with him/her.But still i must give little insight about me.
To start with , i must tell you i m a bit socially conserved or you can say introvert
But once you get to know me you will unwhirl deep mysteries and get a good friend who may be teasing you every now and then but will be by your side till end.
Also adding i am an ultralevel procastinator and try to delay each and every work given to me.
Also you will find hard to find people as lazy as me and as hard working as me(when the work drives me) around you.
Your first impression of me may not be quite good as you can feel that i am being rude but no you know INTROVERTS they are like that only and they can't help it but YOU CAN..!!
Wanna know me better? Do come for a coffee..!!!

You can ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.
